# iranica-reader
Chrome extension for making [http://www.iranicaonline.org/](Encyclop√¶dia Iranica) articles easier to read online.

Find it in Chrome Stores (coming soon).

## List of features

* Removes noisy transliteration diacritics (using [https://github.com/dundalek/latinize](latinize))
* Makes section headers clearly visible
* Moves in-text citation to linked footnote
* Adds collapsible footnotes section at the end
* Collapse date and date ranges to only show Gregorian dates (Islamic dates are shown on mouse hover)
* Splits long paragraphs

### Features in the works
* Lightbox images (no page change)
* Options page (maybe?)

## Caveats

Much of the reformatting is done via regular expressions and not all the articles follow a strict format or have correct markup.  

If you notice something odd, temporarily disable the extension, or open the page in incognito mode.
